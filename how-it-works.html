              Kihearts Network renders four services namely: Donation and
              Reward Crowdfunding, Investment, Loan and Advertising.
              <br /><br />

              There is a 4 steps registration process which covers all the
              services rendered by Kihearts:
              <br /><br />

              Step 1: Collects your personal data plus your preferred login
              username and password.
              <br /><br />

              Step 2: Collects your fund request
              <br /><br />

              Step 3: Is where you make a one time registration payment of
              $1.50₵ or ₦500.
              <br /><br />

              Step 4: Is where you make pledge. The minimum pledge amount is
              ₦100 or $1 and the maximum pledge amount is ₦20,000 or $200.
              <br /><br />

              Now let's see how each services works: <br /><br />

              <!-- CROWDFUNDING -->
              <div id="crowdfunding">
                <b>CROWDFUNDING</b>
                <br /><br />

                After completion of the 4 registration steps, your fund campaign
                becomes Active but if you've skipped the registration fee (step
                3), your fund campaign will be inactive pending when you've
                paid.
                <br /><br />

                Every fund campaign goes through 3 stages before funds
                campaigned for are paid. These stages are: the Active stage, the
                Published stage and the Selected stage.
                <br /><br />

                💠The Active Stage <br /><br />
                Your fund campaign becomes active immediately after you complete
                the four steps registration process. At the active stage, you
                can edit your fund campaign information but when its published,
                you can't edit anymore.
                <br /><br />

                At this stage, you are expected to generate 20,000 Gold Coins
                (GC) before you could be able to publish your fund campaign for
                selection and funding. Below are ways to generate Gold Coin (GC)
                and the amount of Gold Coin (GC) for each way: <br /><br />
                (a) For successful completion of the registration process, you
                get 1,000 GC. <br /><br />
                (b) For making pledge you get 100 GC pending till you fulfill
                the pledge. That is for every pledge you make, you get 100 GC
                each but they all remain delayed till you fulfill all. If you
                fulfill 3 out of 5 pledges you made, you get rewarded for 3
                pledges fulfilled. <br /><br />
                (c) For fulfilling your pledge, you get rewarded according to
                the amount you donated. The higher the amount donated, the
                higher the Gold Coin reward. Minimum donation amount is $1 or
                ₦100, GC reward is 100 and maximum donation amount is $200 or
                ₦20,000, GC reward is 2,000. <br /><br />

                NOTE: You can make multiple pledges. When pledges are made, the
                pledge info box becomes Green. When the system selects you to
                fulfill your pledge, a 3 days timer and a fulfill pledge button
                appears on the pledge info box, click the fulfill pledge button
                to make donation. The system gives you 3 days to fulfill your
                pledge. After fulfilling your pledge, the pledge info box
                becomes Golden and then the system rewards you with Gold Coin
                according to the amount donated and your pending GC for making
                the pledge will reflect in your Gold Coin Wallet. <br /><br />
                (d) For each daily login (once), you get 100 GC <br /><br />
                (e) For promoting Kihearts on social medias with your affiliate
                link, you get 50 GC. <br /><br />
                (f) For every new member joining Kihearts through your affiliate
                link, you get 250 GC. <br /><br />
                (g) For every new member you sent welcome message, you get 5 GC.
                <br /><br />
                (h) For your testimony: <br /><br />
                Video testimony, you get 1,000 GC and plain text testimony, you
                get 500 GC. <br /><br />
                <br /><br />

                When you have successfully gathered 20,000 GC, a "Publish"
                button will appear on your fund campaign info box. Click the
                publish button to get your fund campaign published for possible
                selection and funding. <br /><br />

                💠 The Published Stage <br /><br />
                At this stage, the system selects campaigns starting from the
                least requested amount first and then moves to the higher ones.
                <br /><br />

                The system selects all funds campaigns starting from the least
                fund amount first and when it gets to a total fund amount equal
                to or a little less than the total pledge amount, it stops
                selecting until new pledge amounts reaches the set Benchmark
                amount to enable the system resume selection again.
                <br /><br />

                For emergency cases, there is an exemption, the system selects
                the first 5 emergency cases before it begins the above selection
                process of taking the least fund campaign amount first.
                <br /><br />

                💠 The Selected Stage <br /><br />
                Its at this stage that fund campaigns selected from the
                published stage are funded with the total amount of fulfilled
                pledges. It takes roughly 3-5 working days to transfer all funds
                to their respective campaign owners.
                <br /><br />

                NOTE: 5% commission fee and recommitment fee is deducted from
                every successful fund campaign. That is 2.5% for commission and
                2.5% for recommitment.
                <br /><br />

                The Crowdfunding services runs on a two e-wallet system - Gold
                Coin e-wallet and Cash e-wallet.
                <br /><br />

                💰Gold Coin E-wallet: This e-wallet is where all the Gold Coin
                earned by members are held. When yours reaches 20,000 GC, you
                can use it to publish your fund campaign. Also, at any amount of
                GC earned, you can decide to sell your GC at this fixed price
                range - $0.01₵ - $0.05₵ or ₦1 - ₦5. The money paid to purchase
                your Gold Coin goes into your cash e-wallet and its ready for
                withdrawal at anytime.
                <br /><br />

                💰Cash E-wallet: The cash e-wallet is the main wallet as it
                holds all cash earned from the following: sell of Gold Coin,
                Crowdfunding, Investment and affiliate commissions.
                <br /><br />

                Affiliate Commission for the Crowdfunding service is 50% of the
                recommitment fee of 2.5% deducted from the fund campaign amount
                of the person you referred to the Kihearts Network. The other
                50% is rolled back into the system to help other members.
                <br /><br />

                NOTE: Referral is not compulsory as the Kihearts program is not
                a Multi Level Marketing (MLM) program, it is not Networking as
                some of you think. But if you want to make money from the system
                apart from the money you get from your fund campaign, referring
                is the only way. <br /><br />

              <b><i>OPPORTUNITIES IN KIHEARTS NETWORK</i></b>
              <br /><br />

              Every active member of Kihearts Network has equal opportunity to
              make more money on this platform. Below is an example explaining
              the money making potentials on Kihearts Network platform.
              <br /><br />
              =Example= Assuming you referred only one person and he/she
              applied for the four services offered by Kihearts Network;
              considering the least and highest possible scenarios, let's
              check what you could be earning from each of the four services
              as an affiliate, excluding profits from your own investment and
              funds you gained through crowdfunding. <br /><br />

              <b>Crowdfunding</b>
              <br /><br />

              Now, you were able to refer one person, let's assume he or she
              campaigned for Business Startup Capital of $5,000 or $15,000. On
              the day he or she would be paid, this is what you will get:
              <br /><br />
              5% deduction of transaction fee and commitment fee is taken from
              the total amount of $5,000 or $15,000 campaigned for by the
              person you referred. The transaction fee takes 2.5% and likewise
              the commitment fee <br /><br />
              $5,000 X 2.5% = $125 (Transaction fee) <br /><br />
              $5,000 X 2.5% = $125 (Commitment fee) <br /><br />
              50% affiliate commission of the commitment fee $125 is paid to
              you while the other 50% is rolled back into the system to
              support other members financially. <br /><br />
              ∆ $125 X 50% = $62.50¢ <br /><br />
              You get $62.50¢ and the other $62.50¢ goes back into the system.
              <br /><br />
              If its $15,000 then: <br /><br />
              $15,000 X 2.5% = $375 (Transaction fee) <br /><br />
              $15,000 X 2.5% = $375 (Commitment fee) <br /><br />
              50% affiliate commission of the commitment fee $375 is paid to
              you while the other 50% is rolled back into the system to help
              others. <br /><br />
              ∆ $375 X 50% = $187.50¢ <br /><br />
              You get $187.50¢ and the other $187.50¢ goes back into the
              system. <br /><br />

              <b>Investment</b>
              <br /><br />

              Here we will make two projections, considering if he or she
              invested with the minimum amount on the Bronze package or the
              maximum amount on the Diamond package. <br /><br />
              Bronze minimum — $50 X 5% = $2.50¢ (Profit) <br /><br />
              Diamond Maximum — $50,000 X 50% = $25,000 (Profit) <br /><br />
              Remember we pay you 5% affiliate commission on profit earned by
              the investor you referred; therefore: <br /><br />
              Bronze Minimum: $2.50¢ X 5% = $0.125¢ (your commission)
              <br /><br />
              Diamond Maximum: $25,000 X 5% = $1,250 (your commission)
              <br /><br />

              <b>Loan</b>
              <br /><br />

              Let's assume he/she takes the minimum amount for personal loan
              or the minimum amount for business loan and pays back when due.
              <br /><br />
              Personal Loan — $10 X 5% (interest) = $0.50¢ <br /><br />
              Business Loan — $1,000 X 5% (interest) = $50 <br /><br />
              Your affiliate commission will be 30% of the interest amount
              he/she paid; therefore: <br /><br />
              $0.50¢ X 30% = $0.15 (your commission) <br /><br />
              $50 X 30% = $15 (your commission) <br /><br />

              <b>Advertising</b>
              <br /><br />

              Assuming he/she pays for the least advert plan or the highest
              advertising plan: Daily Plan — $0.50¢ X 30% (Affiliate
              commission) = $0.15¢ <br /><br />
              12 Months Plan — $90 X 30% (Affiliate commission) = $27
              <br /><br />

              <b>Summary</b>
              <br /><br />

              Crowdfunding commission — $62.50¢ (minimum) or $187.50¢
              (maximum) <br /><br />
              Investment commission — $0.125¢ (minimum) or $1,250 (maximum)
              <br /><br />
              Loan commission — $0.15¢ (minimum) or $15 (maximum) <br /><br />
              Advertising commission — $0.15¢ (minimum) or $27 (maximum)
              <br /><br />
              Total commission — $62.925 (minimum) or $1,479.50¢ (maximum)
              <br /><br />
              So for referring one person, you could be earning between
              $62.925¢ - $1,479.50¢ if the person applies for all the
              services. Imagine what you could earn if you referred more than
              one person.
